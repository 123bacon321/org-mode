* Some Demo Ideas

** block as function
** properties
** use of a table
** interesting data from bash to R

*** file sizes
Maybe something like the following which outputs sizes of directories
under the home directory, and then instead of the trivial =emacs-lisp=
block we could use an R block to create a nice pie chart of the
results.

#+srcname: sizes
#+begin_src bash :results replace
du -sc ~/*
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :var sizes=sizes :results replace
(mapcar #'car sizes)
#+end_src

*** something using grep

*** something with the kernel
*** something with processes or user activity
