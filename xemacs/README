This directory contains files that are necessary or at least useful
companions for Org-mode:

noutline.el   Greg Chernov's port of the overlay-based implementation of
              outline-mode.  This is requires, and until XEmacs uses
              this (or another port), you need to install it with Org-mode.

ps-print-invisible.el   Greg Chernovs modification to ps-print, to
                        honor invisible text properties during printing.
