Radio links accross files?  Like in Pony?  Or HOWM.
How can this be done in an efficient way?

Ideas for time estimates:

 {22}    22 minutes
 {2:}    2 hours
 {2:30}  2 hours, 30 minutes

What should be done with appointments that show up in the agenda.
Do we need something to distinguish appointment that we have to be
at from dates that are there just for information?

Maybe make a new keyword APPT for appointment, meaning that this is
something I need to attend, as opposed to something which is on that
day and not necessarily something where we need to be present.  Not
sure about this.

Should we add this hierarchically? Should parents value be the summed
values of children?  I guess not.  No.  Estimated times should be
atomic, belonging to the detailed entry.  If people give estimated
times to parents, their fault.

Make variables for case-fold-search, there is a request in the survey
about case-sensitive search in tags or todo, something.

">" does not work well in column view, when currently there is no
width defined.

Make cycling put text properties over current state.
Use thee when moving subtrees, to restore them all to the right
state.

C-RET, add empty line just like before the current entry.

Make sure the remember stuff insertion works correctly, find a way to
specify empty leading lines.

Last synch with FSF changes: <2008-01-03 Thu>

Fix special character replacement:  not in protected regions, and
require them not to be part of a long chain of strings and dots.

Write CLOCK like this: CLOCK [2007-11-12 Mon 12:30-13:44]
This needs a lot of changing, of course.  Clock table and lots more.

Make org-entry-put handle all special properties.  Use interactive
interfaces only for interactive calls.

Split into files:
- org.el
- org-tables.el
  entry points: align.  Hmm, mybe we should just leave it like it is.
- org-agenda.el
- org-export.el
- org-cdlatex.el

Also, all the link types could be in separate files:
Still, org would automatically require these.
I guess it would make some sense to take these out.
- org-bbdb.el
- org-mh.el
  etc etc

How to set tags in remember buffer?

integrate org-iswitchb.el

Free up C-c C-v, and use this for other stuff?

document org-agenda-start-day and maybe other dynamical scope variables.

Should I move the remember template stuff to remember.el itself?
Would be good, but is unlikely to happen.

Make org-set-property set the property for all entries in the region. 
What other commands?

Map region with commands, general mechanism????

M-q in a line starting with a *bold* string fails.  Fuck this wrapping
and paragraph code, it is a desaster

- Agenda view of tags search make the levels of the headline visible
  through leading dots.  The TODO view doesn't.  Maybe the to views
  should behave the same on this?

- Modifying the TODO state of an entry while in the agenda tags-todo
  view will make the leading dots disappear.

Make ASCII export remove some of the emph markers.  Maybe replace
verbatim with single quotes or so.

ASCII export: move links into footnotes

Implement cycling by having a text property on headlines, instead
of doing all this work to figure things out dynamically????????????

Write some command that does:
- gets all the external stuff from David an Bastien
- Changes the version number so that they are consistent
- Have a contrib directory?????

Implement Johns auto-archive.

Have C-c C-e 0 l  and C-c C-e 0 h do the region (Bastien)

Remove time grid lines that have an apointment on that time.
Don't show "-----" if something is going on during that time,
this is an indication of being occupied.

Implement block viewing in the agenda, to show how long enties take on
a true time grid.

End date for a repeating thing?

Should we have thinks like <example> ... </example>
like muse does?  This is much easier than what we have......

#+BEGIN_example
#+END_example

Completely remove cpltxt from store link and use desc instead.

Implement most internal links as add-ons.  Either in external files,
or internally.  Anyway, make sure most of them are active.

Bug with columns when there is an invisible link early in the
headline. See properties.org.

hooks in the properties stuff.

org-after-insert-property-drawer-hook.

Function to convert outline to plain and back (Scott Jaderholm)

MEW support??? (this is yet another emacs mailer)

Make org-fill-paragraph respect \\.

How can I update a calculating property without relying on the column
view format?  That would require specifying the format in an
additional place, possibly in a data field?  This is what I had
first.  Maybe it was only partially a good idea????
The problem is that in order to have a column computing, we need to
have a view!  So this is not good!

Options:
 - use the format!
 - have an extra property, like XYZ_OPERATOR.
   Then do the operation in the sub tree of the entry that has the
   operator property.  Quite nice, this one, but may contradict
   the format.  It is not goot to have this multiple times.  So maybe
   strictly limit this to those that are in a format.

   + when updating, find the format and then apply to subtree.
   + When updating absolutely everything, find all the formats, get
     all the operators, apply to the corresponding subtrees.

   + allow very general operations:

     {to-number,to-string,add}

     Or simply {add}

     Take old value, new value, and add or do whatever is necessary.

     This is another exploit.

     Three functions.

 - Allow the operator in a value after all

search-subtree command/function

Should the default for org-archive-mark-done be nil?

hook after agenda-show, but careful with all the other functions
that use that function.  Maybe take the functionality tp a separate
function.

Make something search [-].


The fast interfaces


- org-goto, jumps to an entry in the current buffer
- org-refile, uses the completion interface to file something away
- org-refile with prefix arg allows to jump to a refile location
- remember can use refile, goto, and automatic location search

This is very much confuing:

refile standard can go to any refile location, in different files
we can also us the refile interface to find a headline in the
current buffer.

This needs to be made more consistent.
