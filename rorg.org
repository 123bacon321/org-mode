#+TITLE: rorg --- R and org-mode

Please feel free to change the layout of this file, I'm just putting
this here to get things started.

* Objectives
** Import data into R from org
   Org-mode includes orgtbl-mode, an extremely convenient way of using
   tabular data in a plain text file.  Currently, spreadsheet
   functionality is available in org tables using the emacs package
   calc.  It would be a boon both to org users and R users to allow
   org tables to be manipulated with the R programming language.  Org
   tables give R users an easy way to enter and display data; R gives
   org users a powerful way to perform vector operations, statistical
   tests, and visualization on their tables.

*** Implementations
**** naive
     Naive implementation would be to use =(org-export-table "tmp.csv")=
     and =(ess-exec "read.csv('tmp.csv')")=.  
**** org-R
     [[file:existing_tools/org-R.el::defun%20org%20R%20export%20to%20csv%20csv%20file%20options][org-R-export-to-csv]]
**** org-exp-blocks
**** RweaveOrg
     NA

** Editing R code using r-mode from an org buffer
   Org has an extremely useful method of editing source code and
   examples in their native modes.  In the case of R code, we want to
   be able to use the full functionality of ESS mode, including
   interactive evaluation of code.

*** Implementations
**** Org
#+BEGIN_SRC org
#+BEGIN_SRC r

,## hit C-c ' within this block to enter a temporary buffer in r-mode.

,## while in the temporary buffer, hit C-c C-c on this comment to
,## evaluate this block
a <- 3
a

,## hit C-c ' to exit the temporary buffer
#+END_SRC     
#+END_SRC

**** Org-R
     NA

**** org-exp-blocks
     NA

**** RweaveOrg
     See [[file:existing_tools/RweaveOrg/org-sweave.el][org-sweave.el]] and [[file:existing_tools/RweaveOrg/export_testing.R][export_testing.R]]

** evaluate R code and make the output available for processing in an org buffer
** evaluate R code and format the output for export
