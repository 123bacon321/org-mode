#+TITLE: rorg --- R and org-mode

Please feel free to change the layout of this file, I'm just putting
this here to get things started.

* objectives
What are these?

I'll pre-populate with a quick list from the email to get started

Just to get this out there, there seem to be four kinds of
functionality we're trying to get here:
1. import data into R from org
2. easy editing of R code using r-mode from an org buffer
3. evaluate R code and make the output available for processing in an
   org buffer
4. evaluate R code and format the output for export
